# MightyEnchants
This is one of my first plugins aimed at making some custom enchantments that would be very usefull while playing minecraft. It uses a custom GUI to "buy" enchantments.

## Thus far these enchantments have been implemented:
- Triple shot. A bow can be enchanted with this to shoot 3 arrows at the same time. (Costs 1 diamond) 🏹

## These enchantments are being worked on:
- Rainbow trail for arrows shot from a bow/crossbow. 🌈
- Explosive mining for a pickaxe. 💥
- Treefeller for an axe. This allow you to chop a whole tree down at once. 🌲



If you have any ideas on enchantments that i should add, put it in the issues with the enhancement tag. All ideas are welcome!
