# MightyEnchants
This is one of my first plugins aimed at making some custom enchantments that would be very useful while playing minecraft. It uses a custom GUI to "buy" enchantments.

## Thus far these enchantments have been implemented:
-  :bow_and_arrow: Triple shot. A bow can be enchanted with this to shoot 3 arrows at the same time. (Costs 1 diamond)

## These enchantments are being worked on:
- 🌈 Rainbow trail for arrows shot from a bow/crossbow.
- 💥 Explosive mining for a pickaxe.
- 🌲 Treefeller for an axe. This allow you to chop a whole tree down at once.



If you have any ideas on enchantments that i should add, put it in the issues with the enhancement tag. All ideas are welcome!
